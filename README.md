# pred-distance

This is a from scratch ML flask app for my daily prediction distance based on my own distance data collected daily since three years. 
These are time series data.

# Goal : Set up a entire mlops process from data collection up to daily retraining and monitoring

## I will deploy the model locally and on cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP) using github CICD operations

This a personal project developped from scratch by me. 

## Project's steps and code
**Clone a repository**
